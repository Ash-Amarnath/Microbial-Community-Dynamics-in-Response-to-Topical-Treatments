# Microbial-Community-Dynamics-in-Response-to-Topical-Treatments
Welcome to the repository for "Microbial Community Dynamics in Response to Topical Treatments". This research, presented at the annual Disease Ecology Meeting at St. Michael's College and the Celebration of Excellence Conference at Norwich University, delves into the microbial dynamics influenced by topical treatments. 
With a goal to combat unwanted germs and prevent serious issues, particularly in sensitive environments like NASA and hospitals, our study focuses on identifying methods to deactivate or eliminate harmful bacteria. Given the rising concern of bacterial resistance, our research examines resistance patterns through the analysis of 16S rRNA. Delve into our findings and insights presented in the attached materials.
